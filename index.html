      <h1>Problems with Cash Handling.</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">As a business owner, you likely accept cash payments from customers. Although convenient for customers, this comes with a slew of cash handling problems for you. Problems that cost you time and money and lead to frustration. In order to increase your cash management efficiency and boost productivity and security as well as lower costs and losses, you should seriously consider tightening your cash handling procedures.</h5>
      
      <h3 class="w3-padding-16">No Accountability</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">When your cash handling procedures aren’t as tightly controlled as they could be, then you probably lack proper accountability. Cashiers share registers. Employees are in and out of the vault without record. There’s no chain of custody when cash is moved. When you have no accountability when it comes to your cash, it’s really difficult for you to track down where and when errors happened, which means it’s almost impossible to fix them and avoid similar mistakes in the future. It also means you won’t be alerted to suspicious behaviour as soon as possible. With a cash management solution, your cash will be reported and recorded every step of the way, so you’ll know exactly when something is amiss.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Risk of Theft</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Cash handling opens you up to both internal theft and robbery. Employee theft can take place at any point in the cash cycle: during transactions, while cash is in transit, while it’s being counted, while it’s being deposited, or any other time. If your cash handling procedures aren’t controlled, you can almost guarantee that dishonest employees will take advantage of any opportunity they have to steal from your business. A cash management solution will allow you to automate your systems so every dollar is accounted for—this will make it too risky for employees to help themselves to your money because the likelihood of them getting caught increases considerably.
      Robbery is also a possibility when you handle cash at your establishment. If you keep too much cash on hand or your money is exposed to customers at any point, you risk getting robbed. Keep your money secure with a cash management solution and you won’t be such an easy target. For example, a currency recycler can double as a vault to protect your cash.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Counterfeit Fraud</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Counterfeit fraud is real. Tech-savvy criminals have almost perfected the task of printing fraudulent bills—in every denomination. If you accept this fake cash, you’ll be the one suffering the loss at the end of the day. To protect your business from counterfeit fraud, invest in state-of-the-art counterfeit detectors for every cash register. They will quickly alert you to any suspicious bills so you can refuse them before they become your problem.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Transactional Errors</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Though your employees try their best to complete transactions correctly, errors will inevitably occur. You can reduce the instances of transactional errors by automating your systems so technology does most of the work and properly training your staff to accept and dispense cash. They should feel completely comfortable processing any type of transaction: from making voids and processing refunds to handing out discounts. It’s your responsibility to provide them with the right documentation and training.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Accounting Errors</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">It’s easy to lose count, record numbers incorrectly, skip numbers, and mix up denominations when handling large volumes of cash, especially when your employees are tired or distracted after a long day. When your employees are counting and sorting money at the end of the night, your risk of accounting errors increases. To ensure greater accuracy, you should be investing in cash counters and sorters that automatically count, sort, and report totals. Take human error out of the equation and your risk of accounting errors is greatly reduced.</p>

      <h1>Smart Cards for secure and fast transactions</h1>
      <h2>With demonetisation, go from offline to online transactions</h2>
      <img class="cust-image w3-padding-32" src="./images/demonetisation-online.png" width="100%" height="100%">
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">The recent demonetisation announcement has left many people facing cash crunch in the country with many of them queuing up in bank branches and ATMs. This problem could have been avoided had India strengthened its payment infrastructure enabling merchants and consumers to accept payments digitally. Digital payments change the way merchants accept payments through new technology adoption of mobile wallets, virtual PoS, online banking which will result in an increase of online and cashless transactions the country.</h5>
      
      <h2>Offline to online: The giggest moment for India to move towards cashless revolution.</h2>
      <img class="cust-image w3-padding-32" src="./images/cashless-revolution.png" width="100%" height="100%">
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">
          <ul>
              <li>Currently India has over 1 million PoS (Point Of Sale) terminals for 100 million small businesses, which indicates a huge gap in the payment acceptance network.</li>
              <li>If we list the elements required to go cashless, then we need a bank account, a debit or credit card and a device which can accept and request payments.</li>
              <li>As per RBI data release on card statistics as on August 2016, India has more than 73 Crore credit and debit cards issued by banks and more than 25 crores Jan Dhan.</li>
              <li>Also, India has become the 2nd biggest Smartphone market in terms of active unique smartphone users, crossing 220 million users, according to a report by Counterpoint Research.</li>
          </ul> 
      </h5>
      
      <h2>Smartphones for digital payments</h2>
      <h2>Virtual POS - A smarter way to accept digital payments</h2>
      <img class="cust-image w3-padding-32" src="./images/paytm.png" width="100%" height="100%">
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">A traditional PoS system requires a minimum investment from the merchant either as rental fees, installation charges or even fixed telephone costs, wherein with virtual PoS merchant accept payments without having to swipe the card into a physical device. Advantages? No fixed costs and no monthly fees.</h5>
